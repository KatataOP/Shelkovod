# [Shelkovod](https://shelkovod.com)	

Shelkovod is an eco farm and cottage cooperative located in Ukraine, between Kharkiv and Merefa.
This repo is a web based application designed to help with Shelkovod's activities. It is also a beta testing ground for project codename "Transparent Politics", created by Kirill Afan as a result of the Kharkiv Civilian Relief efforts he had started during the Ukraine - Russia conflict of 2022.

Transparent Politics is an attempt to automate the manual work that has been done by [Kharkiv Civilian Relief](https://gogetfunding.com/kharkiv-civilian-relief-efforts/) and their volunteers during Ukraine war. It aims at simplifying, itemizing, archiving, veriftying, and surfacing to public view the aspects of running and funding community living, as well as not for profit fund management and distribution activities. 

When people get together, sooner or later they elect leaders and distribute resources for public benefit. Through out history there were many attempts at doing this efficiently, the modern political system is somewhat a representation of the latest thinking on the subject; in an incredible over simplification - people elect representatives, who debate, decide on rules, then collect taxes, which are later distributed for public good. We aim at making the aspects of ideal democracy more transparent and open source. We want to minimize and eventually remove the potential for missunderstanding, missinformation, emotion, and corruption from this process.
